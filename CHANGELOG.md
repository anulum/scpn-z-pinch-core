SCPN Z-Pinch Core — CHANGELOG
-->

# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Portable diagnostic-plan envelope
  (`src/scpn_z_pinch_core/plan_envelope.py`,
  `scpn.reactor-diagnostic-plan-envelope.v1` version `1.0.0`): a
  producer-owned, canonically serialised wrapper carrying project
  identity, exact owned configurations, capability and maturity,
  synthetic/review-only/non-actuating statements, both SPO registry
  pins, the inner plan's SHA-256, the producer revision, and fixed
  no-observation/no-control non-claims; strict parsers refuse unknown,
  duplicate, and non-finite members, and an immutable committed fixture
  exercises the exchange end to end.

- Diagnostic and clock semantics model
  (`src/scpn_z_pinch_core/observability.py`), the second implemented
  capability at `computational_prototype`: frozen clock, channel,
  deferral, and plan objects aligned fail-closed with the pinned SPO
  observability-profile catalogue (candidate applicability, carrier
  admissibility, exact class-fixed evidence vocabularies, clock-kind
  compatibility, Nyquist and event-timing bounds); cited advisory band
  and timing checks; canonical serialisation with SHA-256 digests and
  strict NaN-rejecting round-trip parsing (design record
  `docs/adr/0003-diagnostic-clock-semantics.md`).

- Device configuration model (`src/scpn_z_pinch_core/`), the first implemented
  capability at `computational_prototype`: validated frozen parameter
  objects with device-specific invariants and documented, cited
  consistency estimates; canonical serialisation with SHA-256 digests
  and strict NaN-rejecting round-trip parsing; a data-only pin to the
  SPO reactor registry; and the reactor-domain validator branch
  enforcing populated capability inventories with the ADR 0002
  evidence-maturity ceiling rule (design record
  `docs/adr/0002-device-configuration-model.md`).

- Architecture-only repository scaffold: governance, security, licensing,
  REUSE metadata, contribution and support policies, and citation metadata.
- Machine-readable domain manifest `reactor-domain.json` binding the project
  to SCPN Phase Orchestrator reactor registry `1.0.0`
  (configurations `sheared_flow_z_pinch`, `z_pinch`).
- Device-owned CONTROL adapter specification and threat model.
- Derived Studio portfolio descriptor (`not_federated`) and generated
  capability inventory (zero implemented capabilities).
- Validation tooling: domain-manifest validator, descriptor derivation and
  inventory generation with drift checks, and a fail-closed preflight
  orchestrator, each with statement- and branch-complete tests.
- Continuous-integration, code-scanning, security-audit, documentation,
  SBOM, pre-commit, and Scorecard workflow definitions (read-only
  permissions; no publication or deployment workflows).

### Changed

- Studio portfolio descriptor schema ratified at version 1.1.0 after
  downstream review, before any consumer adoption (1.0.0 superseded
  unconsumed): canonical JSON Schema published in-repository with a strict
  unknown-field policy, explicit source repository, nullable lifecycle
  evidence pointer, nullable versioned control-intent reference, ratified
  capability item shape, and a machine-protection object (independent
  final-veto owner with availability `not_assessed`) replacing the former
  boolean flag.
