SCPN Z-Pinch Core — VALIDATION
-->

# Validation

Every gate currently active in this repository, with its exact scope,
followed by the evidence record of each implemented capability.

## Local gates

| Gate | Command | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Lint | `ruff check .` | all Python under `src/`, `tools/`, and `tests/` |
| Format | `ruff format --check .` | same scope |
| Typing | `mypy --strict src tools tests` | zero errors, strict mode |
| Tests + coverage | `pytest -q --cov=src --cov=tools --cov-branch --cov-fail-under=100` | 100 % statement and branch coverage of `src/` and `tools/` |
| Domain manifest | `python3 tools/validate_reactor_domain.py reactor-domain.json` | schema, registry version/digest, exact configuration set, capability inventory shape and ceiling rule, safety boundary |
| Studio descriptor | `python3 tools/derive_studio_descriptor.py --check` | committed descriptor byte-identical to a fresh derivation |
| Capability inventory | `python3 tools/generate_capability_inventory.py --check` | committed inventory byte-identical to a fresh generation |
| Licensing | `reuse lint` | REUSE 3.x compliance of the full tree |
| Workflow lint | `actionlint` | all files under `.github/workflows/` |
| Documentation | `python3 tools/preflight.py --only docs` | UTF-8 readability and relative-link integrity of every Markdown file |
| Orchestrated | `python3 tools/preflight.py` | fail-closed run of all gates above |

## Workflow gates (definitions present; run on the hosted platform once a
remote exists under separate owner authority)

| Workflow | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | run-always lint, format, typing, tests, coverage, domain checks |
| `pre-commit.yml` | exact pre-commit parity |
| `codeql.yml` | Python code scanning |
| `security-audit.yml` | secrets, dependency, licence, and workflow policy |
| `docs.yml` | strict documentation and link validation, no deployment |
| `sbom.yml` | reproducible dependency inventory, no release |
| `scorecard.yml` | read-only supply-chain analysis |

## Shared ecosystem gate

From the monorepo root:

```bash
python3 agentic-shared/scripts/repository_tier0_scaffold_audit.py \
  03_CODE/SCPN-Z-PINCH-CORE --json
```

proves the Tier-0 local-scaffold machine profile (required and forbidden
paths, Git/remote boundary, workflow pins and permissions, badge non-claims,
JSON integrity, defensive ignore rules).

## Device configuration model

Evidence record of the `device_configuration_model` capability
(`computational_prototype`; design record: `docs/adr/0002-device-configuration-model.md`).

What is exercised, all under the 100 % statement-and-branch coverage gate:

- Validated frozen parameter objects (`PinchColumn`, `Discharge`,
  `DeviceConfiguration`) rejecting non-finite values, non-positive
  extents, and the hard flow-shear class invariants: strictly positive
  declared shear for `sheared_flow_z_pinch` (the stabilising mechanism
  that defines the class; Shumlak & Hartman, PRL 75 (1995) 3285) and
  exactly zero for the static `z_pinch` — every rejection branch is
  tested.
- The Bennett-relation temperature `T = mu0 I^2 / (16 pi N e)`
  (Bennett, Phys. Rev. 45 (1934) 890) as a documented derived quantity,
  with an advisory finding outside the documented `[1 eV, 100 keV]`
  pinch plasma window, reported and never clamped.
- Canonical serialisation (sorted keys, NaN/infinity rejected on both
  emit and parse), SHA-256 digest identity, and a strict round-trip
  parser that refuses unknown fields.
- A data-only pin equality check binding the model to the SPO reactor
  registry version and digest declared in `reactor-domain.json`.

Bounded claims — what is NOT claimed:

- No parameter set describes, approximates, or validates any real
  machine; every exercised parameter set is a synthetic test fixture.
- The estimates are advisory regime checks, not equilibrium, stability,
  or yield results; no benchmark, dataset, solver, controller, or
  experimental correlation exists in this repository.
