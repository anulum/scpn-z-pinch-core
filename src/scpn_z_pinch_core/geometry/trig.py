# SCPN Z-Pinch Core — deterministic unit-circle trigonometry

"""Vendored deterministic sine and cosine for bit-exact tessellation.

Mesh vertices are generated from points on the unit circle. Platform
``libm`` implementations of ``sin`` and ``cos`` are not guaranteed to be
correctly rounded and differ between languages and libraries, so the
native kernels could not reproduce the Python floor bit for bit if either
side called them. Both sides therefore evaluate the same degree-15 sine
and degree-16 cosine Taylor polynomials in Horner form on ``[0, pi/4]``
with the identical operation order, and build the remaining points by
exact octant and quadrant symmetry (sign changes and swaps only). The
truncation error of both polynomials on ``[0, pi/4]`` is below one half
unit in the last place of the result; the accumulated rounding error is
a few units in the last place, bounded by the accuracy test against
``math.sin`` and ``math.cos`` in the test suite. Nothing here describes a
device; it is the numerical substrate of the geometry.
